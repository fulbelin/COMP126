    <div class="secondary box">Candle-making is not as difficult as it may seem! All you really need is a container, wax, and a wick. Here are step-by-step instructions for making a candle:

        First, melt enough wax to fit your container in a double boiler.
        Second, put your wick onto the center of your container.
        Third, pour the melted wax into your container and wait for it to cool. (Make sure your wick is centered!)
        
        There you have it! A beautiful candle.
